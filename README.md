## Efficient Implementation of Spiking Neural Networks for Inference using Ex-Situ Training

This page contains all the necessary Python implementation files and trained models regarding the paper "Efficient Implementation of Spiking Neural Networks for Inference using Ex-Situ Training".

**NEW: The research paper behind this work called "Efficient Implementation of Spiking Neural Networks for Inference using Ex-Situ Training" was published and can be read here**: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10681427

For the ex-situ training, I made use of the SNNtrainer3D application proposed earlier here (improved to support training SNNs on multiple datasets such as XOR and MNIST): https://github.com/jurjsorinliviu/SNNtrainer3D/ and published at https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/13/5752
