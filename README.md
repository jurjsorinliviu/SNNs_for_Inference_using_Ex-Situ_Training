## Efficient Implementation of Spiking Neural Networks for Inference using Ex-Situ Training

This page contains all the necessary Python implementation files and trained models regarding the paper "Efficient Implementation of Spiking Neural Networks for Inference using Ex-Situ Training".

For the ex-situ training, I made use of the SNNtrainer3D application proposed here (improved to support training SNNs on multiple datasets such as XOR and MNIST): https://github.com/jurjsorinliviu/SNNtrainer3D/
